# Sizeable Design - Product Website Redesign

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design a static single-page website for **Sizeable Design**, a startup building a groundbreaking product, **the Offgrid Phone**. The new website replaces the old design services-oriented landing page with a more product-focused website. The objective was to showcase the company's product without mentioning that it's a one-person business.

The static website consists solely of HTML, CSS, and images, providing a temporary replacement for the original site. It includes sections such as:

- **Introduction to Sizeable Design**
- **Flagship Product Overview**
- **Product Features**
- **Testimonials**
- **Product Video**
- **Product Specifications**
- **Pre-order Call-to-Action**
- **Footer with basic contact information**

The website also links to the **Offgrid Phone** product landing page.

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **Shifting the Brand from Design Services to a Product Focus**
   - **Challenge**: The original website (www.sizeabledesign.com) focused on design services, but the new website needed to position Sizeable Design as a startup building a single product.
   - **Solution**: I rewrote most of the copy to focus on the product—**the Offgrid Phone**—instead of design services. This included removing any references to a design studio or design services and replacing them with language that reflected the company as a startup dedicated to creating innovative technology.

### 2. **Creating a Clean, Modern Design with Limited Resources**
   - **Challenge**: The project only allowed the use of static HTML, CSS, and images. Without JavaScript or dynamic features, I had to create a polished, professional look using only those technologies.
   - **Solution**: I focused on a clean, minimalist design with clear sections for each piece of content. I utilized modern CSS features such as Flexbox and Grid Layout to ensure the layout was responsive across devices. I also used media queries to make sure the website adapted well to different screen sizes. Images were carefully selected to ensure they were high quality, but optimized for web usage.

### 3. **Ensuring Responsiveness and Mobile Friendliness**
   - **Challenge**: The website needed to be fully responsive, meaning it had to look good and function well on both desktop and mobile devices.
   - **Solution**: I implemented responsive design principles using media queries. I started with a mobile-first approach and used percentage-based widths for the layout elements. As the screen size increases, the layout adjusts to provide the best possible experience for each device, whether it’s a small phone or a large desktop screen.

### 4. **Maintaining Brand Consistency**
   - **Challenge**: The new website needed to retain some aspects of the original brand identity while ensuring it was modernized for a new product-focused business.
   - **Solution**: I kept the primary color palette intact (blue tones, white, and gray) but streamlined the design elements for a more modern and professional feel. I also ensured that fonts were simple and readable, and that the layout was clean and minimal to highlight the product.

### 5. **Linking to the Existing Product Landing Page**
   - **Challenge**: The new website needed to link to the existing product landing page (www.offgridphone.com) while maintaining its own identity and purpose.
   - **Solution**: I added a call-to-action section in the footer and within the main content that links directly to the **Offgrid Phone** landing page. This was a straightforward approach to ensure users would easily be able to access more detailed information about the product.

### 6. **Optimizing for Performance**
   - **Challenge**: Since this was a static site, I needed to ensure it loaded quickly and performed well even with images and other assets.
   - **Solution**: I compressed images using tools like TinyPNG to reduce file sizes without compromising too much on quality. I also used modern CSS techniques to reduce the amount of custom scripts and resources required, which improved the website’s overall performance.

## Lessons Learned

- **Importance of User Experience**: Even though this was a simple static site, I learned the importance of creating an intuitive and engaging user experience. A clean design with clear, easy-to-read text and strategically placed calls-to-action is essential, even for a small, temporary website.
  
- **CSS Layouts Are Powerful**: I was able to leverage the power of CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a flexible, adaptive layout that worked seamlessly across various screen sizes. These tools are incredibly useful for creating responsive designs without relying on JavaScript.

- **Compression and Optimization Matter**: It’s easy to overlook the importance of image optimization, but compressing images significantly improved the page load times and ensured that users didn’t experience lag when browsing on mobile devices.

## Future Improvements

If I were to continue improving this website, here are a few things I would consider:

- **Adding Interactive Elements**: While the static site works well for this specific use case, adding more interactive elements like a contact form or dynamic product info could make it more engaging.
  
- **SEO Optimization**: The website could benefit from better search engine optimization (SEO). I would implement structured data and optimize meta tags for better discoverability.

- **Analytics Integration**: Adding basic tracking like Google Analytics would allow us to understand user behavior and improve the website further based on data.

## Conclusion

This project was an excellent opportunity to work on a simple, yet impactful, website redesign. By focusing on modern, clean design principles and responsive layout techniques, I was able to create a polished static site that effectively communicates the company’s new direction as a product-focused startup.

The challenges I faced were primarily around ensuring the site was mobile-friendly, visually appealing, and aligned with the new brand identity. Ultimately, I believe the result is a website that positions Sizeable Design as a serious player in the tech space, with a clear focus on **the Offgrid Phone** as its flagship product.
